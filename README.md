#Main objectives to be completed
Main purpose of this Battleship implementation was to have a simple game that is looping through 100 times with coordinates that either represent a miss or a hit.
There are 2 empty tables in an SQL format generated by postgresql 
Each combination of **letter** and **number** you put in represents a sing move that populates the movement s table and the games table. 
Hit and completeness conditions are both booleans and only display true if it's true. 
Completeness is the wining condition. 
To win the game you would have to hit all the coordinates that the 2 ships
